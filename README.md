# Multi-agent-system-with-langGraph
This Python script demonstrates a collaborative multi-agent system using LangChain and LangGraph. The system is designed to solve queries by combining two specialized AI agents: a Research Agent and a Writer Agent. Each agent is powered by OpenAI's GPT  model and performs distinct roles within the workflow.
